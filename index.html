<div id="content">
 <p>My name is Rébecca Chemouil, I was born in 1979 and I founded Pony in 2019. When I was little, I dreamed of saving gorillas and being a French teacher. <br>
    I took a slight detour, finally spending twenty years in marketing and communications, in agencies and with advertisers. <br>
    It was out of a deep desire to move the boundaries and assume that she wasn't like anyone that Pony was born. <br>Far from marketing clichés and dogmas, I adopt a unique, joyful and authentic style in order to support clients from all backgrounds and meet wonderful people so that I never get bored. <br>I like to be alongside those who have the courage to create, to build, to invent, to help them reveal themselves. <br>
    I listen, analyze and identify the smallest detail, even the most buried, to make each subject a unique case in order to build together a positioning, an identity, a storytelling and a strategy that only resembles you .</p>

    <p >Creative director, photographer, web designer, <br>
        community manager, strat planner, director…<br>
        The PONY community is large, creative, motivated and free. Here neither permanent contract nor underpaid intern, each expert is freelance, and is identified for their performance and emotional intelligence.<br><br>
        Why this model?<br>
        To always have the freedom to truly choose who to work with. Each team is made up <br>
        to talent and feeling, so that everyone is in their zone of genius and gives the best of themselves. <br>
        And if it is necessary to call on another agency, we happily collaborate with the most inspiring and expert people possible.<br>
        Beyond skills, the subject must animate everyone, make them vibrate. <br>
        The client's state of mind and method must match those of the stakeholders, in order to reveal the best of all, and make each project a great adventure.</p>
